The project implements superpixel level saliency detection 
Superpixels are obtained using the SLIC (Simple Linear Iterative Clustering)
Features are extracted per superpixel. They include average rgb values of all pixels within, average lab values of all pixels within, local binary pattern, entropy.
GBVS and Itti Koch are priors for classlabels.
Extreme Learning Machine is used for classification.
